# nft_web

### Project is based on the design By HRIDOY. I did a design cut work just for free and just because I liked it. The NFT web is coded only for the desktop screens that means non-responsive. Design prepared only for the desktop: url -> https://www.figma.com/file/cequ64a6vSrrbQcTxbwrkv/nft-web?node-id=2%3A13
